<h2>LINE OF SIGHT</h2>

Video series screening<br>
Chicago Artists Coalition | BOLT exhibition space<br>
Thursday, March 19, 2015<br>
7:00-8:30 PM<br>
<br>
Free and open to the public.<br>
 
<p>Dark Fiber, an inaugural collaboration by Chicago-based artists Marissa Lee Benedict & David Rueter, is a single-channel video installation on view from March 6-26. Streamed into the gallery over a fiber optic cable that snakes up from the basement studios, the video follows the artists as they labor, through acts practical and imagined, to fabricate the infrastructure of a new, unauthorized high-speed global telecommunications network.</p>

<p>On March 19th, Dark Fiber will go dark, and a video and film series, curated via an open call to artists and filmmakers, will take over the screen.</p>
 
<p>Although open in its curatorial premise, the videos selected for the Line of Sight festival will critically address (1) the method of the video or filmâ€™s transmission from author to gallery and (2) the media format and/or playback device by which the video is projected in the gallery.</p>
 
<p>Methods of submitting media for the festival could potentially include: radio link, live stream or anonymous dead drop; delivery via U.S. postal system, bike messenger or in-person transfer.</p>
 
<p>Potential formats or playback devices for the screening could be: a Western Digital media player, a DVD/Bluray disc, a laptop with a wireless internet connection, a TV monitor, an LCD screen or a 16 mm film reel and projector. **The gallery will be equipped with a projector and a media player; if needed, a laptop, TV monitor and/or a DVD/Bluray player can be provided. Other types of media playback device must be provided by the artist.</p>
 
<p>Additional Details:<br>
All videos and films should be no more than 10 minutes in length.
The video or film must be originally produced by the artist or collective submitting.</p>
